# About:

This is an implementation of a Virtual Machine for the
[LC-3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Computer_3) computer, written in
Go.

It was inspired by [Justin Meiners' and Ryan Pendleton's article](https://justinmeiners.github.io/lc3-vm/index.html).

It can run implementations of programs such as:

- [2048](https://github.com/rpendleton/lc3-2048):
- [Rogue](https://github.com/justinmeiners/lc3-rogue):
